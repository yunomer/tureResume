## üíª Local Development

### Method 1: npm

1. `git clone https://github.com/yunomer/tureResume.git`
2. `cd tureResume`
3. `npm install`
4. `cp .env.example .env.local` (and fill in your values)
5. `npx prisma migrate dev` (or `npx prisma db push`)
6. `npm run dev`
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Method 2: Docker

1. `git clone https://github.com/yunomer/tureResume.git`
2. `cd tureResume`
3. `cp .env.example .env.local` (fill in values on host)
4. Ensure database (from `.env.local`) is running and accessible.
5. `npx prisma migrate dev` (run on host)
6. `docker build -t ture-app .`
7. `docker run --env-file .env.local -p 3000:3000 ture-app`
8. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   This command maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host and passes the environment variables from your host's `.env.local` file into the container.
7. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see Ture live.

**Note on Docker and Database:** These instructions assume your database (specified in `DATABASE_URL`) is accessible from the Docker container. This might mean it's running on `host.docker.internal` (for Docker Desktop), a specific IP address, or you're using a custom Docker network. For development setups where the database is also containerized, using `docker-compose` is often a more robust solution.
